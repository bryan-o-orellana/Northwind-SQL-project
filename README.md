# 🌐 Northwind Sales Analysis — SQL + Power BI Project

## 📘 Overview
This project analyzes sales data from the **Northwind** sample database using **SQL Server** and visualizes key business metrics in **Power BI**.  
It demonstrates SQL skills for **data analysis**, **query optimization**, and **business intelligence reporting** — from database creation to advanced analytics and dashboards.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design a **data model** using the *Star Schema* approach.  
- Write **SQL analytical queries** to extract key business insights.  
- Apply **CTEs**, **window functions**, and **stored procedures** for dynamic and advanced reporting.  
- Build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to visualize sales performance and trends.

🧩 Data Model

The project follows a simplified Star Schema, including the following tables:

Table	Type	Description
FactVentas	Fact	Contains sales transactions
DimEmpleado	Dimension	Employee details
DimCliente	Dimension	Customer information
DimShipper	Dimension	Shipper/transport details
DimTiempo	Dimension	Date and time dimension

📄 See assets/diagrama_erd.png for the full ERD diagram.
